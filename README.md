Task 2 - Unemployment Analysis using Python:


This project analyzes the unemployment scenario before and after the lockdown using Python. It includes data analysis, visualizations, and insights derived from 
the provided dataset.

Features
Analyze the unemployment rates, employment, and labor participation for different states and regions.
Visualize the unemployment rates through various plots and charts.
Compare the average unemployment rates before and after the lockdown.
Explore the impact of lockdown on employment in different states.
Deployed as a web application using Streamlit for a better user interface.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available in the data.csv file. It contains information about unemployment rates, employment, labor participation, and other relevant factors for different states and regions.

Code
The unemployment-analysis.ipynb file contains the Jupyter Notebook code used for data analysis and visualization.
The app.py file contains the Streamlit code for deploying the project as a web application.
The requirements.txt file lists the dependencies required for running the Streamlit app.
Deployed Application
The project has been deployed as a web application using Streamlit. You can access the deployed application here.

Additional Notes
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of unemployment rates using Python as part of the data science internship at Oasis Infobyte. I explored various visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in unemployment data. The project includes descriptive statistics, heatmaps, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and geographical plots to gain insights into the impact of lockdown on employment.

I also deployed the project as a web application using Streamlit, which provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the analysis results.
